# VGG Image Search Engine (VISE)

VGG Image Search Engine (VISE) is a free and [open source](https://gitlab.com/vgg/vise) software for visual search of large collection of images using image region as a search query. VISE is developed and maintained by Visual Geometry Group ([VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/)) in Department of Engineering Science of the Oxford University. VISE is released under a [license](https://gitlab.com/vgg/vise/-/blob/master/src/LICENSE.txt) that allows unrestricted use in academic research projects and commercial industrial applications.

VISE builds on the C++ codebase developed by [Dr. Relja ArandjeloviÄ‡](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~relja/) during his DPhil / Postdoc at the Visual Geometry Group in 2014. VISE is developed and maintained by [Dr. Abhishek Dutta](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~adutta/). [Prof. Andrew Zisserman](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/) guides and supports the development of VISE.

Development and maintenance of VISE software has been supported by the following two grants:
 * Visual AI: An Open World Interpretable Visual Transformer (UKRI Grant [EP/T028572/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FT028572%2F1))
 * Seebibyte: Visual Search for the Era of Big Data (EPSRC Grant [EP/M013774/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M013774/1))
